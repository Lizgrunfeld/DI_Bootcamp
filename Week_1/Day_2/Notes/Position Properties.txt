static every element has a static position by default, so the element will stick to the normal page flow. So if there is a leftrighttopbottomz-index set then there will be no effect on that element.

relative an element’s original position remains in the flow of the document, just like the static value. But now leftrighttopbottomz-index will work. The positional properties “nudge” the element from the original position in that direction.

absolute the element is removed from the flow of the document and other elements will behave as if it’s not even there. 
The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element

fixed the element is removed from the flow of the document like absolutely positioned elements. In fact they behave almost the same, only fixed positioned elements are always relative to the document, not any particular parent, and are unaffected by scrolling.

sticky the element is treated like a relative value until the scroll location of the viewport reaches a specified threshold, at which point the element takes a fixed position where it is told to stick.

`#one { position sticky; top 10px; }`
...would position the element with id `one` relatively until the viewport were scrolled such that the element would be less than 10 pixels from the top
